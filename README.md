Explanation
•  Flashcard Class: 
•	A Flashcard class is created to store the front, back, review interval, and last review date. This makes the code more organized and object-oriented.
•  Spaced Repetition Logic: 
•	The spaced_repetition function implements the core spaced repetition algorithm.
•	It uses a review queue (a list of tuples) to keep track of flashcards and their next review dates.
•	The cards are sorted by their next review date.
•	The interval is doubled when the user gets the answer right, and reset when the user gets it wrong.
•	The code now accurately tracks the days since the Epoch, and correctly calculates the next review days.
•  Time Handling: 
•	time.time() // 86400 is used to get the number of days since the epoch, which is a more accurate way to track time for spaced repetition.
•  User Input: 
•	The code now prompts the user for input to determine if the answer was correct.
•  Clear Output: 
•	The code provides clear output to the user, including the front and back of the flashcard, and the next review date.
•  Simulated Delay: 
•	time.sleep(1) simulates waiting between reviews when there are more cards to review.
•  Easily Extensible: 
•	Adding more flashcards is as simple as adding more Flashcard objects to the create_flashcards function.
•  Corrected Logic: 
•	The code now correctly implements the spaced repetition algorithm. This improved implementation provides a functional and more accurate spaced repetition system.
